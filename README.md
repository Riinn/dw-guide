# dw-guide

Working in progress. Expected to finish it in this weekend. I don't have time at the moment.


Bandersnatch's in-out call out message is complete. Odd-Even counting is not necessary, but it should be easy to implement it you demand.


Demoros' call out messages

IN then OUT or OUT then IN

Double RED circles

Laser

Ball moving clockwise or counter-clockwise


TODO:
